Discord Bot
Hi there! This is a Discord Bot I made for a server that my friends and I have. It's a simple one, but it gets the job done. It monitors channels for 'banned' words (that can be defined by users) and hands out strikes if they are said in chat. Once a user reaches 3 strikes, they are kicked from the server.
